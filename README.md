# Melanoma (Skin Cancer) detection on a smartphone app

This Android application analyzes a lesion image and can classify it as benign or suspicious of melanoma. It is developed using computer vision library OpenCV 3.2 and Java in Android Studio. The code is developed by Upender Kalwa at Iowa State University (2019).

## Requirments

### Environment Setup

- Download & Install [Android Studio]

- Download and extract [OpenCV Android Pack] 3.2.0 folder and then set `OPENCV_ANDROID_SDK` environment variable pointing to the downloaded folder location

- Clone this repository and copy pre-built libraries files

```cmd
  git clone https://github.com/ukalwa/melanoma-detection
  mkdir melanoma-detection\app\src\main\jniLibs
  REM copy the libraries from opencv to this location
  xcopy /E %OPENCV_ANDROID_SDK%\sdk\native\libs melanoma-detection\app\src\main\jniLibs
```

- Now open Android Studio and select *Open an existing Android Studio Project*

- Navigate to the melanoma-detection directory and select it

- When it prompts to install necessary tools, select OK.

- After all the necessary tools are installed, the project is ready to be tested.

- Click `Build -> Make Project` to build the apk. If you get errors at this step, please check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) guide.

- Before running the apk, check to make sure files `opencv_java3.so` and  `libactive_contour.so` are in the apk which can be found at `<project-root>/<module-root>\build\outputs\apk\debug`

- Now `Run` the project to install the apk on an android device and install OpenCV_manager when prompted.

## Steps involved

The code performs following steps:

1. Reads in dermoscopic lesion image by taking image from the smartphone camera coupled with a [10x lens] or reads an image from the SD card.
2. Preprocess the image by applying color transformation and filtering
3. Segment the lesion from the image using active contour model
4. Extract features (*Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colors, Diameter*) from the lesion
5. Classify the lesion based on the features extracted using an SVM classifier and output the result.
6. Save the processed images and results

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an error like `fatal error: 'opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp' file not found`, it most likely means that the OPENCV_ADNROID_SDK path is incorrect. You can check this the `cmake_build_command.txt` at this location `<project-root>/<module-root>/.externalNativeBuild/cmake/<build-type>/<ABI>/`.

  - To resolve this, restart the computer to get the environment variables reflected in Android Studio.

- If you get an error after installing OpenCV_manager, uninstall it and install the apk in SDK at `%OPENCV_ANDROID_SDK%\apk`.

```cmd
  REM for x86 device
  adb shell %OPENCV_ANDROID_SDK%\apk\OpenCV_3.2.0_Manager_3.20_x86.apk
```

- If you get any other error, try cleaning the project and building the project. If it doesn't work, please raise an issue.

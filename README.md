Melanoma detection on a smartphone
==================================

This android application analyzes a lesion image and can classify it as benign or suspicious of melanoma.
It is developed using computer vision library OpenCV 3.2 and Java in Android Studio.

Requirments
===========

*Environment Setup*

- Download & Install [Android Studio] (**Recommended**)

- Download [OpenCV Android Pack] and set OPENCV_ANDROID_SDK environment variable with the download location

- Clone this repository and copy necessary files

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ukalwa/moledetection
cd moledetection\app\src\main\jniLibs
REM copy the libraries from opencv to this location
xcopy /E %OPENCV_ANDROID_SDK%\sdk\native\libs .
```

- Now open Android Studio and select *Open an existing Android Studio Project*
- Navigate to the moledetection directory and select it
- When it prompts to install necessary tools, select OK.
- After all the necessary tools are installed, the project is ready to be tested.

Steps involved
==============

The code performs following steps:

1. Reads in dermoscopic lesion image by taking image from the smartphone camera coupled with a [10x lens] or reads an image from the SD card.
2. Preprocess the image by applying color transformation and filtering
3. Segment the lesion from the image using active contour model
4. Extract features (*Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colors, Diameter*) from the lesion
5. Classify the lesion based on the features extracted using an SVM classifier and output the result.
6. Save the processed images and results
